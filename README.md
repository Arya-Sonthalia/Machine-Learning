## Problem statement: 
You are hired by one of the leading news channel CNBE who wants to analyse recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.
## Discription:

The given data is about the election. It has 2 categorical coulmns are rest are numerical columns. The attributes displayed in the datasets are vote,age, economical.condition.national,economic.condition.household , Blair,Hague, Europe, Political.knowledge and Gender.
## EDA 
Performed Univariate and Bivariate Analysis,exploratory data analysis,Check for Outliers
## Inferences on Univariate analysis:
1.	No outliers present in ’age’ variable.
2. There are 2 variable in the attribute ‘Vote’.
3. As visible in count plot of variable ‘vote’ more inclination is for labour than conservative.
4.	Economic conditions of household and national level follow distribution as per common knowledge
5. very few people have neutral opinions. 
6.’Blair’ has more positive opinions.
7.’Hague’ has more negative.
8.’Europe’ variable has 11 categories
7.’gender’ variable has similar proportion of male and female.
## Model building 
### Comparision of model and Best model :
Random forest classifier , NB Model , Logistic regression are model which seems to perform fair
•	LINEAR REGRESSION AND NB MODEL SEEM TO HAVE PERFORM WELL 
•	BAGGING AND BOOSTING AS WELL HAV GOOD
